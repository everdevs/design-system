# Dev Helpers

The `dev-helpers` package provides several components and utilities to help during the development process.

## Install

### NPM

```bash
npm install @evernest/dev-helpers --save
```

### Yarn

```bash
yarn add @evernest/dev-helpers
```

## Ensure theme injection

### Wrapper

Since most components need a theme to render correctly you might have to wrap your component in a
`ThemeProvider`. You can use `Wrapper` to make sure everything renders as expected.

```js
import { Wrapper } from "@evernest/dev-helpers";
import { Accordion, AccordionProps } from "@evernest/accordion";

const WrappedAccordion: React.FC<AccordionProps> = (props) => <Wrapper><Accordion {...props}/></Wrapper>

test("Accordion can do something", () => {
	const wrapper = mount(<WrappedAccordion/>);
	expect(wrapper.find(Accordion)); // Add expectations
});
```

### withTheme

In some cases, enzyme methods must be run on the root component, and you cannot use `Wrapper` or
`ThemeProvider`. To make ensure that your component has access to the theme, you can manually add it or
create a themed version of your component with `withTheme`.

```js
import { withTheme } from "@evernest/dev-helpers";
import {theme } from "@evernest/theme";
import { Button, ButtonProps } from "@evernest/button";

const ThemedButton = withTheme<ButtonProps>(Button, theme)

test("Button can do something", () => {
	const wrapper = mount(<ThemedButton/>);
	expect(wrapper); // Add expectations
});
```
